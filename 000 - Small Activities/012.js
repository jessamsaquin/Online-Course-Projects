// Exercise 2. Use the completed code from the previous task, but convert the conditionals to a switch statement.
// When you code the solution, the output in the console should remain exactly the same as in the previous question.

// Note: You'll need three separate cases for the three medals, and a default case for all other values of the i variable.

var i =1;

for (var i; i <=10; i++){

   switch (i) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Gold medal");
    break;
    case 2:
        console.log("Silver medal");
    break;
    case 3:
        console.log("Bronze medal");
    break;
    default:
        console.log(i)

   }

}
